# Backtrack – Apple Music Branding & Disclosure Strategy

## Goal
Use Apple Music branding **strategically and compliantly** to:
- Preserve gameplay secrecy (no song identity until reveal)
- Align with MusicKit JS and Apple Music identity expectations
- Increase perceived credibility and trust
- Avoid framing Apple Music as intrusive marketing

Core principle:
> **Borrow trust, not attention.** Apple Music should reassure players, not compete with the game.

---

## Design Constraints
- Audio (clip or full song) may play **before** the card is revealed
- **Title, artist, and album art must remain hidden** until REVEAL
- Apple Music must be clearly credited as the audio source
- Song-specific promotion must only occur when identity is disclosed

---

## Phase-by-Phase Strategy

### 1. PLACE Phase (Audio plays, identity hidden)

**Objective:**
- Reassure players that audio is legitimate and licensed
- Avoid leaking any identifying information

**What to show:**
- Small, approved **Apple Music lockup/badge** (unmodified)
- Neutral attribution text, e.g.:
  - "Audio preview provided by Apple Music"

**What NOT to show:**
- Song title, artist, or album art (even blurred)
- Song-specific Apple Music links
- Dominant or repeated Apple Music branding

**Rationale:**
- Transparency without disclosure
- Clear provenance of audio
- Maintains fairness and suspense

---

### 2. REVEAL Phase (Card revealed)

**Objective:**
- Shift from gameplay concealment to music discovery
- Clearly associate the revealed song with Apple Music

**What to show (adjacent in the same component):**
- Album art
- Song title
- Artist name
- Approved **“Listen on Apple Music”** badge/link

**Rationale:**
- This is the natural discovery moment
- Aligns with Apple Music’s intended promotional use
- Avoids any implication that previews replace full listening

---

### 3. End-of-Game Recap Screen

**Objective:**
- Reframe the session as a music discovery experience
- Provide continued value beyond gameplay

**What to show:**
- List of all songs featured in the game
- For each song:
  - Title + artist (optionally small album art)
  - “Listen on Apple Music” badge/link

**Rationale:**
- Reinforces legitimacy
- Encourages post-game exploration
- Strengthens Apple Music alignment

---

## Mode Framing (Party vs Concert)

- **Party Mode**
  - Fast pacing, short clips
  - Framed as competitive and high-energy
  - Apple Music attribution remains present but subtle

- **Concert Mode**
  - Full-song playback via Apple Music
  - Relaxed pacing, listening-focused
  - No need to declare it “superior” by default

**Important:**
- Capability asymmetry (clips vs full songs) is sufficient
- Marketing language can remain neutral and situational
- Be ready to reframe Concert Mode as “best experienced” if Apple ever asks

---

## Branding Guardrails

- Use **only approved Apple Music badges/lockups**
- Do not modify, animate, or recolor Apple branding
- Keep Apple Music marks **secondary to game UI**
- Do not describe Party Mode as “full music without subscription”
- Do not hide the existence of Concert Mode

---

## Strategic Benefits

This approach:
- Preserves gameplay integrity
- Maximizes player trust
- Signals legitimacy and polish
- Reduces platform risk
- Allows easy future reframing if required

---

## One-Line Guiding Rule

> **Disclose Apple Music early, promote Apple Music late, and never let it overshadow the game.**
